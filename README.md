# dropbox-invite

## Introduction

This gem allows you to invite other users to a shared folder in Dropbox. It's
known that Dropbox API doesn't allow this operation, however it's a requirement
in some scenarios.

To achieve this functionality, the library relies on
[rest-client](https://github.com/rest-client/rest-client) and
[nokogiri](http://www.nokogiri.org), which are be used in combination
to reproduce what a human would do through the public web interface.

## How to use
